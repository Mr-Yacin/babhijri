17:39:34 [ERROR] [vite] ✗ Build failed in 938ms
[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "$lib/stores/auth" from "C:/Users/yacin/Documents/babhijri/src/components/app/profile/ProfileCreationWizard.svelte".
This is most likely unintended because it can break your application at runtime.
If you do want to externalize this module explicitly add it to
`build.rollupOptions.external`
